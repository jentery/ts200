    <p><em>Technology is the campfire around which we tell our stories.</em> -- Laurie Anderson</p>

    <a id="hello" class="anchor" href="#hello"><img src="hello.png" alt="Hi"></a>
    <p>As an offering in the <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/techsoc/index.php" target="_blank">Technology and Society minor</a> at UVic, this course is about the entanglement of society and culture with technologies. We'll examine some histories of these entanglements, discuss their effects today, and also speculate about their trajectories. One important question will persist throughout the term: how can and should we intervene in technologies as practices? Rather than treating technologies as tools we use or objects we examine from a distance, we'll prototype with and through them as a form of inquiry. You'll turn patents into 3-D forms, compose and implement design scenarios, "datify" old tech, and imagine a device you want to see in the world. You'll document your research and development process along the way, reflect on what you learned, present your prototypes and findings, and also develop a vocabulary of "keywords" for technology and society. I will not assume that you're familiar with fields such as media studies, technology studies, or cultural studies, and the prototyping exercises will rely on low-tech approaches. Technical competency required: know how to send an email. I'm looking forward to working with you.</p>

    <h3>MODULE 1: Memory, Novelty, Obsolescence</h3>
    <p>Technologies are entwined with the social and cultural production of memory, novelty, and obsolescence. Consider the use of search engines to recall information, the rate at which mobile devices are discarded, or how frequently software demands an update. What might history tell us about these issues, and what might we learn from prototyping old technologies that were once new?</p>
    <p><strong>KEYWORDS</strong>: affect (Anna Munster), angel of history (Walter Benjamin), archaeology (Wolfgang Ernst and Jussi Parikka), black box (Bruno Latour), entanglement (Karen Barad), failure (Edward Jones-Imhotep), formats (Jonathan Sterne), index (Mary Ann Doane), infrastructure (Shannon Mattern), interface (Lori Emerson), magic (Carolyn Marvin), memory (Wendy Hui Kyong Chun), new media (Lisa Gitelman and Lev Manovich), planned obsolescence (Giles Slade and Kathleen Fitzpatrick), preservation (Dene Grigar), remediation (Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin), and storage (Matthew Kirschenbaum)</p>

    <p><strong>M 25 SEPT</strong>: Finish and Present Your First Prototype (before and during class) </p> 
    <p><strong>LOG FOR MODULE 1</strong> (11 Sept - 25 Sept): Find a patent (dated between 1850 and 1950) for a technology that no longer exists, is no longer popular, or both. Determine why it was considered to be novel during its time, and also why it was rendered obsolete. Also determine what the technology was expected to "remember" (recall, process, and/ or compile) for people. After you've conducted this research and written down your findings in your log, use materials of your choice (e.g., paper, cardboard, plasticine, and software) to bring your technology off the page, translating your 2-D patent into a 3-D form. (Bonus points if you get your prototype to work.) Once you've prototyped the form, use ~400 words to communicate what you learned about memory, novelty, <em>or</em> obsolescence (pick one) from the prototyping process. Be sure to log your research and prototyping as you progress through the module (from 11 Sept to 25 Sept) and include in the log some documentation of the prototyping process (e.g., photographs, sketches, and/or video) as well as notes from the workshops, lectures, and assigned readings and video.</p>

    <h3>MODULE 2: Design, Context, Critique</h3>
    <p>Design is much, much more than adding a layer of polish to a technology. It is also a means of critique, and it can contextualize technology's development and use. While today a lot of popular design is associated with templates, filters, and skins, this module foregrounds it as a scenario, which can be scripted, implemented, and applied to social and cultural issues.</p>
    <p><strong>KEYWORDS</strong>: adaptation (John Ira Jennings), adaptive (Sara Hendren), adversarial (Carl DiSalvo), customization (ginger koons), critical (Jeffrey Bardzell and Shaowen Bardzell), critique (Michel Foucault and Judith Butler), design fiction (Bruce Sterling), embodiment (Jessica Rajko), experiments (Natalie Jeremijenko), graphic (Johanna Drucker), informatics of domination (Donna Haraway), interaction (Paul Dourish), kit-of-no-parts (Hannah Perner-Wilson), making (Matt Ratto and Garnet Hertz), reverse engineering (Anne Balsamo), standards (Susan Leigh Star), storytelling (Erik Loyer), text (Anne Burdick), use (Andrea Botero), and values (Helen Nissenbaum)</p>

    <p><strong>M 16 OCT</strong>: Finish and Present Your Second Prototype (before and during class) | Submit Your Log for Mid-Term Assessment</p>
    <p><strong>LOG</strong>: Return to your first prototype and the corresponding patent. Research the context in which the patent was developed and the technology was used. Look for materials in journals, magazines, advertisements, photographs, online archives/collections, and even fiction. Based on these materials, develop a design scenario detailing how your technology would have been operated (or used, or consumed) during its time. Since you weren't there and you can't inhabit the past, you're scenario will necessarily make an argument about history and even a critique of approaches to the past. The scenario should include the following elements: characters, setting, actions, and a perspective. At a minimum, it should consist of a script, but it will be more compelling if it's accompanied by figures or illustrations. Once it's ready, implement it at least twice. This means you'll need some people in your group to act it out. (Bonus points if you record an implementation and submit the video as part of your log.) Once you've prototyped your design scenario, use ~400 words to communicate what you learned about design, context, or critique (pick one) from the prototyping process. Be sure to log your research and prototyping as you progress through the module (from 28 Sept to 16 Oct) and include in the log some documentation of the prototyping process (e.g., photographs, sketches, and/or video) as well as notes from the workshops, lectures, and assigned readings and web materials.</p>

    <h3>MODULE 3: Labour, Play, Control</h3>
    <p>Digital technologies are frequently associated with discrete-task precarity and 24/7 productivity. Attention produces value (or data), and many decisions are delegated to algorithms and moderators. The work may feel or appear immaterial, too. What, if anything, do we learn from quantifying social and cultural activities, and at this point in history can technologies be used to improve labour conditions?</p>
    <p><strong>KEYWORDS</strong>: algocracy (A. Aneesh), algorithm (Kate Crawford), attention economy (Jonathan Beller), big data (Jodi Dean), casual (Aubrey Anable), control (Gilles Deleuze and Alexander Galloway), Fordism (Karl Marx and Nick Dyer-Witheford), goldfarming (Lisa Nakamura), hacking (Gabriella Coleman), immaterial labour (Maurizio Lazzarato), internet of things (Beth Coleman), labour (Hannah Arendt), Luddism (Karl Marx and Nick Dyer-Witheford), master's tools (Audre Lorde), Mechanical Turk (Ayhan Aytes), moderation (Adrian Chen), noise (Tara Rodgers and Tricia Rose), play (Mary Flanagan), playbour (Trebor Scholz), scientific socialism (Karl Marx and Nick Dyer-Witheford), security (Zach Blas), wages (Selma James), and work (Hannah Arendt)</p>

    <h3>MODULE 4: Speculation, Change, Responsibility</h3>
    <p>Speculation is entangled with imagining alternatives and others worlds, or its used to craft fictions that comment on the present moment. How might it apply to the production of new technologies, especially ones that consciously engage social and cultural issues? And how does speculation stress the aesthetic and political dimensions of technologies in the face of efficiency?</p>

Wise), futures (Damian White), manifesto (Jo Guldi), modern Prometheus (Mary Shelley), retrocomputing (Quinn DuPont), science fiction (Darko Suvin), social justice (Amanda Phillips), speculative design (Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby), speculative fiction (Margaret Atwood), survivance (Gerald Vizenor), utopia (Fredric Jameson), and vapourware (Geert Lovink)</p>
