    <h3>Keywords for Prototyping</h3>
    <p><strong>magic</strong></p>
    <p>Arthur C. Clarke: "Any sufficiently-advanced technology is indistinguishable from <strong>magic</strong>." (<em>Profiles of the Future</em>, Harper & Row 1973, page 21)</p>
    <p>Carolyn Marvin: "It was clear that science could do <strong>magic</strong> better than magicians. But the deeper moral was that conclusions reached by untrained lay eyes, especially amid the distraction of mystery, spectacle, and dramatic sound effects, could not be trusted. What could be trusted was detached scientific knowledge originating in considered texts, able to produce not only the effects of the old <strong>magic</strong>, but other effects that the old <strong>magic</strong> could never produce. Late-nineteenth-century electricians constituted a self-conscious class of technical experts seeking public acknowledgment, legitimation, and reward in the pursuit of their task. Their efforts to invent themselves as an elite justified in commanding high social status and power focused on their technological literacy, or special symbolic skills as experts. They distinguished themselves from mechanics and tinkerers, their predecessors, and from an enthusiastic but electrically unlettered public by elevating the theoretical over the practical, the textual over the manual, and science over craft." (<em>When Old Technologies Were New</em>, Oxford U P 1988, page 61)</p>
    <p><em>Questions</em>: How is technical expertise performed through not only demonstrations but also language? How is it a form of power? When technology appears to be magic or user-friendly, what is rendered either invisible or difficult for many people to observe? Consider labour practices as well as technical elements here. When do we <em>not</em> want technology to be indistinguishable from magic? </p>

    <p><em>The University of Victoria acknowledges and respects the Songhees, Esquimalt, and WSÁNEĆ peoples on whose traditional territories the University stands and whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.</em></p>  

    <p>I owe an incredible debt of gratitude to Carl DiSalvo, Tom Foster, Garnet Hertz, Patrick Jagoda, Virginia Kuhn, Kari Kraus, Tara McPherson, Lisa Nakamura, Amanda Phillips, and Thenmozhi Soundararajan, whose approaches to teaching technology, society, and culture have especially influenced the construction of this syllabus.</p>
