    <h3>Keywords for Prototyping</h3>
    <p><strong>MAGIC</strong></p>
    <p>Arthur C. Clarke: "Any sufficiently-advanced technology is indistinguishable from <strong>magic</strong>." (<em>Profiles of the Future</em>, Harper & Row 1973, page 21)</p>
    <p>Carolyn Marvin: "It was clear that science could do <strong>magic</strong> better than magicians. But the deeper moral was that conclusions reached by untrained lay eyes, especially amid the distraction of mystery, spectacle, and dramatic sound effects, could not be trusted. What could be trusted was detached scientific knowledge originating in considered texts, able to produce not only the effects of the old <strong>magic</strong>, but other effects that the old <strong>magic</strong> could never produce. Late-nineteenth-century electricians constituted a self-conscious class of technical experts seeking public acknowledgment, legitimation, and reward in the pursuit of their task. Their efforts to invent themselves as an elite justified in commanding high social status and power focused on their technological literacy, or special symbolic skills as experts. They distinguished themselves from mechanics and tinkerers, their predecessors, and from an enthusiastic but electrically unlettered public by elevating the theoretical over the practical, the textual over the manual, and science over craft." (<em>When Old Technologies Were New</em>, Oxford U P 1988, page 61)</p>
    <p><em>Questions</em>: How is technical expertise performed through not only demonstrations but also language? How is it a form of power? When technology appears to be <strong>magic</strong> or user-friendly, what is rendered either invisible or difficult for many people to observe? Consider labour practices as well as technical elements here. When do we <em>not</em> want technology to be indistinguishable from <strong>magic</strong>? </p> 

    <p><strong>NEW MEDIA</strong></p>
    <p>Lisa Gitelman: "Newness is a matter of perspective and a moving target. . . . '<strong>New media</strong>' is a tag for present-mindedness, then, but one that calls as much attention to time&mdash;to newness and oldness&mdash;as it does to today's <strong>media</strong> system and its exceptionalism. . . . The studies of old <strong>media</strong> and <strong>new</strong> are thus productively mutual, overlapping, and entangled." (<em>Keywords for Media Studies</em>,  Laurie Ouellette and Jonathan Gray, eds., New York U P 2017, page 130)</p>

    <p>Lev Manovich: "Rather than focusing on familiar categories such as interactivity or hypermedia, I suggest a different list. This list reduces all principles of <strong>new media</strong> to five: numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability and cultural transcoding." (<em>Language of New Media</em>, MIT P 2001, page 44)</p>

    <p><em>Questions</em>: How do we both study and produce <strong>new media</strong>? How does an emphasis on novelty shape our interpretations of pasts and futures? What is the relevance of "<strong>new media</strong>" (as a term) beyond the academy? Where else and how else might it be meaningful?</p>

    <p><strong>PRESERVATION</strong></p>
    <p>Dene Grigar: "There are three types of <strong>preservation</strong> right now: . . . emulation . . . migration . . . [and] collection." (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Cdo1qY30I" target="_blank">"Curating and Preserving Electronic Literature,"</a> Matlit FLUC 2014)</p>
    <p><em>Questions</em>: How do different types of works and technologies demand different approaches to <strong>preservation</strong>? How does <strong>preservation</strong> intersect with re-creation or re-construction? Can we preserve experiences <em>and</em> content?</p>

    <p><em>The University of Victoria acknowledges and respects the Songhees, Esquimalt, and WSÁNEĆ peoples on whose traditional territories the University stands and whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.</em></p>  

    <p>I owe an incredible debt of gratitude to Carl DiSalvo, Tom Foster, Garnet Hertz, Patrick Jagoda, Virginia Kuhn, Kari Kraus, Tara McPherson, Lisa Nakamura, Amanda Phillips, and Thenmozhi Soundararajan, whose approaches to teaching technology, society, and culture have especially influenced the construction of this syllabus.</p>
